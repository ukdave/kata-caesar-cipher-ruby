# Caesar Cipher
Takes a string as input, removes all non-letter characters, applies a
caesar shift cipher of 3, and formats the output into blocks of 5
uppercase characters padded with Xs.

For example, given the input string:

`Hello, this is a test!`

the output will be:

`KHOOR WKLVL VDWHV WXXXX`

## Running

Type `./bin/app` to run the application.

Type `rspec` to run the unit tests.
